# The-War-on-Gaza---A-Humanitarian-Information-Management-System
This Java project, titled "The War on Gaza - A Humanitarian Information Management System," aims to enhance a prior system by incorporating advanced object-oriented programming concepts. The project’s main goal is to improve the software using Java’s principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and file operations. Specifically, the project requires creating abstract classes, implementing interfaces for sorting, introducing exception handling, and applying deep copy mechanisms. The system models families affected by war and involves handling lists of family members, including martyrs and orphans, and managing sorting based on these categories.

Key object-oriented programming concepts play a crucial role in this project:

- Classes and Inheritance: The project uses classes such as Family and abstract classes like Person, which can serve as blueprints for different types of family members. Inheritance allows subclasses like Martyr or LivePerson to inherit properties and methods from 
  the Person class.
- Polymorphism: The system supports polymorphism by allowing different object types to be processed uniformly. For example, the Sortable interface introduces methods for sorting families, which can be implemented differently in various subclasses.
- Deep Copy: A deep copy mechanism ensures that objects like Martyr and Family can be duplicated without affecting the original objects, crucial when manipulating object data.
  By leveraging these features, the project creates a robust and flexible information management system, capable of handling complex data operations while ensuring maintainability and scalability​.
